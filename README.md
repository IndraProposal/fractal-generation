# Fractal Generation Algorithm

This repository contains an algorithm that generates fractals to model the structure and dynamics of the universe. Fractals are complex structures built from simple repeated patterns. Fractals are often used to represent natural phenomena and can be applied to graphics, simulations, and complex system analysis.

## Description

The Fractal Generation Algorithm is a versatile tool that creates fractals, complex structures built from simple repeated patterns. Fractals are often used to represent natural phenomena and can be applied to graphics, simulations, and complex system analysis.

This algorithm can generate various types of fractals, including the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, and Sierpinski triangle. It provides a way to explore the fascinating world of fractals and their applications in understanding the universe's structure.

## Usage

To use the Fractal Generation Algorithm, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def mandelbrot(c, max_iter):
    z = 0
    n = 0
    while abs(z) <= 2 and n < max_iter:
        z = z*z + c
        n += 1
    return n

def generate_fractal(width, height, x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, max_iter):
    image = np.zeros((height, width))
    for x in range(width):
        for y in range(height):
            zx, zy = x * (x_max - x_min) / (width - 1) + x_min, y * (y_max - y_min) / (height - 1) + y_min
            c = zx + zy * 1j
            image[y, x] = mandelbrot(c, max_iter)
    return image

image = generate_fractal(700, 700, -2.0, 1.0, -1.5, 1.5, 256)
plt.imshow(image, extent=(-2, 1, -1.5, 1.5), cmap="hot")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

This code snippet generates a Mandelbrot set fractal and displays it using Matplotlib.
